## Company Introduction
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 1000 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). 
To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked the data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

### Dataset
The team has been given a dataset (CaseStudy2-Data.xlsx) to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine factors that lead to attrition. 

### Tasks
1. The team should identify (at least) the top three factors that contribute to turnover. There may or may not be a need to create derived attributes/variables. 
2. The business is also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”). 
3. The team should provide any other interesting trends and observations from the analysis. The analysis should be backed up by robust experimentation and (where applicable) appropriate visualization. 
4. Experiments, analysis, and visualization must be conducted in R. 
5. Consult with the business owner to get clarifications on the dataset or business goals.
